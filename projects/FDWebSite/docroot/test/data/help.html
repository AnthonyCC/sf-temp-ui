	 bounded by the cartesian product of these option (and thus can be
	 in the several thousands for party packages). The user interface
	 lets the user the specify the maximum number of variations to 
	 select randomly from the set. The implementation guarantees that
	 the instances are uniformly <a href="#random">randomly</a> selected

	 This tool can generate test data according to a given reference distribution.
	 The reference distribution can be given in either as a CSV file of relative
	 frequencies, or they can be picked up from a file of URLs that contain query
	 strings. The tool recognizes the distributions from the file extension.
	 <ul>
	     <li><tt>.url</tt>: a text file which contains URLs with query strings.
	         For example, in the case of products data, it will look for the
		 query parameter <tt>productId=</tt>.
	     <li><tt>.pid</tt>: a CSV file with two columns: product id and frequency.
	     <li><tt>.cid</tt>: a CSV file with two columns: category id and frequency.
	     <li><tt>.rid</tt>: a CSV file with two columns: recipe id and frequency.
	     <li><tt>.did</tt>: a CSV file with two columns: department id and frequency.
	 </ul>
	 The distribution files must be placed in a directory which is specified in the
	 <tt>test.properties</tt> file as the <tt>tests.distributions.path</tt> property.
	 The default is <tt>classpath:/com/freshdirect/resource/test/distro/</tt>.
	 <p>
	 There must also be a manifest file in this directory called <tt>manifest.csv</tt>.
	 This is a csv file where the first column is the distribution's file name and
	 the second column contains a brief description.
	 <p>
	 The tool first loads the distribution and then <a href="#random">randomly</a>
	 samples; generates a random set of with the specified cardinality.
	 <p>
	 Internally, it is a fast implementation of the <i>reverse CDF</i> method.

	 Care has been taken into guaranteeing that the output produced is sufficiently random.

	 <ul>
            <li><b>Reproducibility</b>: There is only one random number seed, which is used to initialize the random number generators.
	        Unfortunately this cannot guarantee that that the exact same output will be produced on
                separate runs. For example, the CMS data may change and some filters (e.g. availability) may
	        pass or fail depending on <i>when</i> the data was generated. Thus it is advisable to keep the retrieved
		data to repeat the test.
	    <li><b>Uniformity</b>: In uniform random sampling, each element of a set shall be picked with
	        the exact same probability. When a given number of elements are chosen from a set of variations,
		it is guaranteed that the chosen set of elements is picked with the same probability as any set of
		unique elements with the same size (sampling without replacement). Also, when selecting the maximum
		number of content keys to match, the filters first run through the entire content key set and <i>then</i>
		the result set is chosen from this remaining set.
	    <li><b>Efficiency</b>: As much as possible, virtual lists are used to represent sets. These do not enumerate
	        the elements explicitly, but can produce them on demand efficiently. In particular, cartesian products
		and concatenations (<tt>com.freshdirect.framework.util.CartesianProduct</tt> and 
		<tt>com.freshdirect.framework.util.ListConcatenation</tt>) are implemented as virtual lists.

CHECKING ACCOUNT TERMS OF USE 
Checking Account Payment. To be eligible to pay for your order from a checking account, the following three conditions must be met: 1) You must have received and paid for at least two prior orders. 2) There must be a valid credit card attached to your FreshDirect customer account. 3) Your FreshDirect customer account must be in good standing. 

Your checking account payment will be processed after your food has been prepared and weighed. FreshDirect will not process orders that use an incorrect or overdrawn checking account. We will make our best efforts to contact you if this occurs. However, in the event such an order is processed, FreshDirect reserves the right to collect funds for any uncollected transactions owed to it. FreshDirect will automatically attempt to process checking account payments two times. If the first request is declined, FreshDirect may charge a nominal fee of $2 per order to cover the cost of exception processing. If the second request is declined, FreshDirect will charge a $25 bounced check fee. Additionally, in the event that sufficient funds are not available in your checking account, FreshDirect will charge the full amount of the order to your credit card. 

If you fail to pay any fees or charges when due or if a redelivery fee or restocking fee is imposed, FreshDirect may charge such amount directly to the credit card identified in your Customer Account Information and may suspend or terminate your access to the FreshDirect Service. You shall be responsible and liable for any fees, including attorneys' fees and collection costs, that FreshDirect may incur in its efforts to collect any unpaid balances from you. Your right to use the FreshDirect Service is subject to limits established by FreshDirect and/or by your bank. FreshDirect reserves the right to withdraw the online check payment option from any account for any reason at any time. 

FreshDirect does not accept paper checks, food stamps, or coupons at this time.

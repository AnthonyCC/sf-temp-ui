Welcome to FreshDirect. PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING TERMS OF USE AND DISCLAIMER CAREFULLY BEFORE USING THIS WEB SITE OR OUR IPHONE APPLICATION (collectively, our "Site"). This Agreement (the "Agreement") is an agreement between you and Fresh Direct, LLC ("FreshDirect") that states the terms and conditions under which you may use the Site and receive FreshDirect service, which includes processing and delivery of product orders (the "FreshDirect Service"). Note that special terms for FreshDirect Corporate Services customers are contained at the end of this Agreement, and, where applicable, those terms supplement or, to the degree that they are inconsistent, supersede these terms. Your use of the FreshDirect Service and the Site constitutes your agreement to the terms and conditions set forth below. If you do not agree with all of the terms and conditions, do not use the Site or the FreshDirect Service.

If you have any questions about this Agreement or the Site please access our Customer Agreement Frequently Asked Questions in the "Help" section of the Site or call our Customer Service team at 1-212-796-8002.

FreshDirect Satisfaction Guarantee
All of our products and services are backed by a 100% customer satisfaction guarantee. If you are dissatisfied for any reason, we want to make it right. Just call us at 1-212-796-8002, contact us via e-mail at service@freshdirect.com or log on and use our Customer Inquiry e-mail. You have up to seven days after delivery, or until the expiration date printed on the product -- whichever is earlier -- to return grocery or perishable products and 21 days for frozen products. FreshDirect may require the return of the product with which you are dissatisfied before we substitute an acceptable item or issue a credit voucher.

FreshDirect Service
Ordering through the Site. Orders must be received before posted cutoff times for a given delivery (see Delivery of Products below for details). Available delivery windows and associated delivery charges and promotions will be shown as you proceed through the ordering process. You can place your order anytime, up to one week before your delivery date. You can modify an existing order (including the addition or deletion of items, a change in the time or delivery date, and the cancellation of your order) via the Web (in the "Your Account" section of the Site) up until the posted cutoff time for that delivery. To view delivery and cutoff times, visit the Delivery Info section of the site. Note that modified orders are subject to price changes and a change of a delivery date may not guarantee the availability of your desired items. You may cancel orders via the "Your Account" section of the Site or by contacting our Customer Service Department at 1-212-796-8002 during posted hours. Please see the Get Help section of the site for Customer Service hours. Cancellation of orders after the required cutoff time will result in a restocking fee equal to the sum of (A) 100% of the total dollar amount of your perishable items (since our perishable items are custom-ordered and guaranteed fresh) plus (B) 25% of the total dollar amount of your nonperishable items.

Price and Availability. At FreshDirect we believe in offering our customers the best product at the best price. We strive to provide you with great prices compared to the competition near your delivery address, and certain items may be priced differently depending on your last delivery address or the address you choose before placing items in your cart. We receive fresh products every day to assure you the highest quality. Although our goal is to fulfill 100% of each order, given the perishable nature of our products, from time to time products may be unavailable due to market conditions beyond our control or to quality that is below our standards. At times when we have an item that's very similar to the item you ordered, we may make a substitution. If you're not happy with the replacement, please email us at subs@freshdirect.com. If we are unable to fulfill your entire order we will make every reasonable effort to contact you prior to delivery. Once you complete checkout, your price, or price per pound/ounce where applicable, is guaranteed unless you placed an order for an item where we have inadvertently listed the incorrect price. In those circumstances, we reserve the right to cancel undelivered orders for such incorrectly priced products; we will contact you immediately in such circumstances, and, of course, your credit card or checking account will not be charged.

     Because we custom-cut, -select, and -order your perishables, the per item price you see in your shopping cart for items we price by the pound/ounce is based on an estimated weight. The final price of these items will be based on the same price per pound/ounce indicated upon completion of checkout, but the actual price is determined once we have prepared and weighed your order, and will appear on the invoice you receive at the time of delivery -- you always pay the true price for the actual weight of your products.
     Please note: we reserve the right to limit your order or the quantity of a particular product that you may order.

Delivery of Products. FreshDirect uses refrigerated trucks with freezer compartments to maintain the quality and integrity of your products. To maintain the integrity of products after delivery, we recommend that you immediately refrigerate or freeze perishable items. We guarantee your products (with the exception of frozen items) will remain fresh in the delivery box at room temperature (78 degrees) for two (2) hours from the time of delivery. Frozen items must immediately be placed in a freezer.

     To receive delivery, you must live in a residential apartment or home and you or your doorman must be present to receive your order from our driver during your selected delivery window. Additionally, after your second order with FreshDirect you may elect an alternate receiver located within your building to accept your delivery. This alternate receiver can accept your goods when you are not present at the time you had selected for delivery and shall accept the goods under all of the same terms and conditions that would apply had you accepted the delivery yourself. Anyone at the delivery address who receives the delivery is conclusively presumed to be authorized to receive the delivery. If you, your doorman, and your alternate receiver are not present during your selected delivery window, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to contact you and reschedule delivery (a $4.99 redelivery fee applies) for that night. In such case, if we are unable to redeliver the order to you for any reason, the order will be canceled and you will be charged a cancellation fee as described above.
     In certain areas, FreshDirect may offer unattended delivery options. If such options are available in your area, separate terms and conditions will be presented to you before you agree to accept such delivery.
     FreshDirect delivers case sizes of a variety of different goods, including laundry detergent, beverages, etc. Given the heavy weight of some of these products, and our concern for the health of our drivers, we have purchase limits on a variety of these items on our web site. Also in the interest of safety, we do not deliver to walk-ups (a building without an elevator) above the 5th floor, or deliver more than 3 cases of beverages above the 4th floor. In the event of a broken elevator, we also do not ask our drivers to carry groceries more than 5 floors. Our technology cannot, and does not, enforce these limits. We ask our customers to abide by these service limitations, as we may limit deliveries when orders exceed these requirements. Again, this limitation exists only to protect the health of our delivery staff. We appreciate your understanding and cooperation.

     In an effort to meet the committed delivery time for all of our customers, our delivery personnel cannot wait for an inspection of the items delivered. Your order will arrive with an invoice that will list all of the items you have received and were billed for and you can always find a copy in the Your Account section of our website. If something is missing from your order, please call our Customer Service department at 1-212-796-8002 or log on and contact us via our Customer Inquiry e-mail form.

     In the case of inclement weather or unforeseen delivery complications, it may be necessary to make adjustments to our delivery schedule, which will cause us to suspend chosen delivery dates and times. If there will be a significant delay, a customer service representative may call or e-mail you to let you know the status of your delivery time. We will deliver your order as quickly as possible when the conditions permit. We will never deliver an order past 12:30 AM without a customer's consent. If your designated delivery location (i.e., street, avenue) or day is inaccessible, rendering us unable to make the delivery, we will contact you to determine the best alternate location and/or date.


     FreshDirect delivery personnel are allowed to accept tips. Customers are under no obligation to tip Drivers but have the option of doing so if exceptional service is provided.

What is the bottle deposit line on my invoice? In accordance with applicable state law, FreshDirect collects a State Bottle Deposit for each bottle of certain items, such as beer, soda, mineral water and still waters.

Your total deposit amount is displayed as a separate line item in your shopping cart and on your invoice.

If you wish to recover the deposit portion of the fees, empty bottles and cans may be redeemed at any redemption center, or you may bring them to the main entrance at our facility at 23-30 Borden Avenue, Long Island City, Queens. FreshDirect can only redeem the deposit for the bottles and cans of products that we sell. Our drivers cannot accept bottles or cans for redemption.

Credit Card Payment. Your credit/debit card will be charged for your order on the day your order is delivered. Since certain perishables are priced by weight and the actual price is not known until we have prepared and weighed your order, we request credit card authorization for up to 125% of the estimated cost of perishables, but only charge you the actual cost that is determined after preparing and weighing your order. In addition, we will authorize your credit card for an amount equal to 100% of the total of the non-perishable items in your order. FreshDirect will not process orders that attempt to use an incorrect, expired, or over-the-limit credit card. We will make our best efforts to contact you if this occurs. However, in the event such an order is processed, FreshDirect reserves the right to collect funds for any uncollected transactions owed to it. FreshDirect may charge a fee of $2 per order should a payment made via credit card be declined resulting in the need for alternate payment or exception processing. If you fail to pay any fees or charges when due (which would include if a check is returned or electronic payment is rejected) or if a redelivery fee or restocking fee is imposed, FreshDirect may charge such amount directly to the credit card identified in your Customer Account Information and FreshDirect may suspend or terminate your access to the FreshDirect Service. You shall be responsible and liable for any fees, including attorneys' fees and collection costs, that FreshDirect may incur in its efforts to collect any unpaid balances from you. Your right to use the FreshDirect Service is subject to limits established by FreshDirect and/or by your credit card issuer.

Checking Account Payment. To be eligible to pay for your order from a checking account, the following three conditions must be met: 1) you must have received, paid for, and had settled at least two prior orders; 2) there must be a valid credit card attached to your FreshDirect customer account; and 3) your FreshDirect customer account must be in good standing.

Your checking account payment will be processed after your food has been prepared and weighed. FreshDirect will not process orders that use an incorrect or overdrawn checking account. We will make our best efforts to contact you if this occurs. However, in the event such an order is processed, FreshDirect reserves the right to collect funds for any uncollected transactions owed to it. FreshDirect will automatically attempt to process checking account payments twice. If the first request is declined, FreshDirect may charge a nominal fee of $2 per order to cover the cost of exception processing. If the second request is declined, FreshDirect will charge a $25 bounced check fee. Additionally, in the event that sufficient funds are not available in your checking account, FreshDirect will charge the full amount of the order to your credit card.

If you fail to pay any fees or charges when due or if a redelivery fee or restocking fee is imposed, FreshDirect may charge such amount directly to the credit card identified in your Customer Account Information and may suspend or terminate your access to the FreshDirect Service. You shall be responsible and liable for any fees, including attorneys' fees and collection costs, that FreshDirect may incur in its efforts to collect any unpaid balances from you. Your right to use the FreshDirect Service is subject to limits established by FreshDirect and/or by your bank. FreshDirect reserves the right to remove the online check payment option from any account for any reason at any time.

FreshDirect is unable to accept paper checks, food stamps, or third-party coupons at this time.

Third-Party Information Providers and Merchants. In certain cases, the FreshDirect Service may permit you to order and receive products, information, and services from businesses that are not owned or operated by FreshDirect. In such instances, FreshDirect acts only as the link between you and such businesses. The purchase, payment, warranty, guarantee, delivery, maintenance, and all other matters concerning the merchandise, services, or information ordered or received from such businesses are covered by their customer agreement and policies and solely between you and such businesses. FreshDirect makes no representations or warranties of any kind, express or implied, regarding the merchandise, services, or information received from such third parties and the fact that FreshDirect makes such products, information, and services available should not be construed as an endorsement of the businesses or the products, services, and information they provide.

						After your second order, we recommend authorizing an alternate recipient in your building (read more below about alternate recipients).
						<br><br>

						Bad weather or other unforeseeable traffic emergencies may force us to postpone or suspend chosen delivery dates and times. If there is a significant delay, a customer service representative will call or e-mail to update you on your delivery status.

When you're not home during your selected timeslot, we will do our best to redeliver your order later the same day (a $<%=(double)user.getBaseDeliveryFee()%> redelivery fee applies). If your order cannot be redelivered that day there is a restocking fee of 100% of the cost of perishable items in the order plus 25% of the cost of packaged goods plus 50% of the total amount of any beer items, excluding fees and tax.
						<br><br>
						We'll always try to deliver your order directly to you. If your building has a doorman, you may authorize him to receive orders on your behalf. After your second order, we recommend selecting a neighbor in your building to receive your order in case you're not home when we arrive. The only catch is that they are responsible for keeping your perishable items cold and your frozen items frozen until you pick them up, so choose a neighbor you know and like &#151; and be sure to ask their permission first.

						<b>Why are there so many boxes in my order?</b><br>
FreshDirect was designed to be the perfect environment for food. We separate different types of food into 12 different climate zones to ensure the quality of our products. Our design for handling food has resulted in three separate assembly processes which create separate boxes for the following:
<ul>
<li>Meat, Seafood, and Produce items packed together 
<li>Dairy, Deli, Cheese, Coffee, and Tea items packed together
<li>Grocery, Specialty, and select non-refrigerated Produce (like bananas and tomatoes) packed together
</ul>
The number of items in a box has a direct relationship to the number of items ordered from a given department. Sometimes, boxes may be packed with only a few items depending on what you have ordered. We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and encourage you to recycle your boxes. Unfortunately, FreshDirect cannot currently pick up or re-use boxes.

						In accordance with New York State law, FreshDirect charges a bottle deposit on certain items. Your total deposit amount is displayed as a separate line item in your shopping cart and on your invoice. 
						<br><br>
						If you wish to recover this deposit, empty bottles and cans may be redeemed at any redemption center or you may bring them to our facility at 23-30 Borden Avenue, Long Island City, Queens.

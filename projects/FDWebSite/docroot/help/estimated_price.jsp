		Every apple, every steak, every cheese varies a little in size and weight. While you shop we show an estimated weight and price for everything priced by the pound. On the day of delivery we assemble your order and weigh each item to determine its final price.<P>
		We guarantee that you'll always pay the true price for the actual weight of your products.<br><br><br></td></tr></td></table>

<p>
<div class="title16">What is Unattended Delivery?</div>
Unattended delivery is a service offered to our Westchester customers. For those who live in individual residences, FreshDirect will now leave your order for you even if you're not at home to receive it.  If you're not at home, the delivery team will carefully repack your order with frozen gel packs to stay cool and fresh, and leave it on your doorstep or other location that you designate in your Special Delivery Instructions.
<br/><br/>
Your order is guaranteed fresh outside for up to 30 minutes.

<p>
<div class="title16">Can my order be left Unattended if I live in an apartment?</div>
This service is currently only available to individual residences in Westchester.  However, all customers are encouraged to authorize an alternate recipient, such as a doorman or neighbor.

<p>
<div class="title16">Why was the wine/beer I ordered removed from my delivery?</div>
We are required by law to deliver alcohol only to individuals who are 21 or older with proof of age.  If you're not at home to receive your delivery, the delivery team will remove the alcohol and your account will be credited for the product that was removed.

<p>
<div class="title16">Are the gel packs included in my order safe?</div>
Yes, we use gel packs that are non-toxic and latex-free.  Use care when handling them while frozen.  

<p>
<div class="title16">Are the gel packs reusable?</div>
FreshDirect will accept returned gel packs and is glad to be able to clean them and reuse them again.  You are welcome to leave them on your doorstep for pick-up upon your next expected delivery, or if you're at home, hand them to the delivery team.

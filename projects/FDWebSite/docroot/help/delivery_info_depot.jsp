				The minimum order is $40. There is a fee of $3.95 for depot delivery. You are under no obligation to tip but have the option of providing a tip if you feel that you've received exceptional service. FreshDirect delivery personnel are not permitted to solicit tips under any circumstances. The delivery fee is not a gratuity for any FreshDirect employee who delivers or is otherwise involved with the delivery of your order and will not be given to any such employee as a gratuity.

          Available to corporations in the Tri-State area with 1000+ employees at a single location, this program is a great way for your company to provide employees with a convenient new way to shop for food.
          <br><br> 
          Here's how it works: Your employees sign up through the FreshDirect Web site and place orders anytime (we'll put your company's logo on the Web site too!). After work on the day of delivery, at a designated spot in the parking lot, employees will pull their car up to one of our refrigerated trucks and FreshDirect staff will put their order in the trunk. That's all there is to it -- you've saved your employees precious time and the food is fresher than the supermarket and better priced to boot.
          <br><br>
If you are interested in our corporate depot program, please e-mail us at <a href="mailto:service@freshdirect.com">service@freshdirect.com</a>
          <br><img src="/media_stat/images/layout/clear.gif" width="1" height="18"><br>
          <b>Special Event Depot Program</b><br>
From football games to concerts throughout the Tri-State area, we'll bring our fresh food wherever the action is. Through one of our special event depots, event attendees can use the FreshDirect Web site to place orders for all of their tailgate or picnic needs. On game day, their food will be waiting for them in the parking lot, in one of our refrigerated trucks. (Unfortunately, the truck's tailgate is not available.) 
          <br><br>

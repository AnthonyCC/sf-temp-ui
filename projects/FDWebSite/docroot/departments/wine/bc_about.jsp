		<font class="space2pix"><br></font>
		<b>Selection.</b> We specialize in handpicked, limited production wines from all over the world representing the best values for $15 or less.
		<br><br>
		<b>Organization.</b> Rather than present our wines by place of origin or grape type, we lay them out based on how they taste, using eight easy-to-comprehend categories. For more on our categories, <a href="javascript:popup('/departments/wine/bc_wine_system.jsp','large')">click here</a>.
		<br><br>
		<b>Information.</b> We write about our wines in a way that is meant to both educate and entertain. Glance at our brief wine descriptions and you'll instantly learn what's in a given bottle of wine and, more importantly, what it tastes like in the glass. Read on, and you'll pick up neat serving tips, tasty food pairings, and a bevy of useless facts you can use to impress your friends.

		There are a lot of great values in the wine world, if you know where to find them. Unfortunately, there are many more wines out there that aren't so great, and at all sorts of prices. Our first duty at Best Cellars is to ensure that none of the lesser stuff gets near our shelves &mdash; or yours! For every bottle that makes it into the store, another ten-to-twenty get the boot. To make our final cut, a wine has to have easy-to-love fruit, beautiful balance, and taste delicious right out of the bottle. Anything less won't do.
		<br><br>
		Many of Best Cellars tastiest discoveries come from producers or places that are off the beaten track &mdash; and offer better value and/or flavor interest than similar, but more heavily promoted, wines. In fact, some of our most exciting wines are Best Cellars exclusives. We work with growers from all over the wine world to bring in artisanal offerings you simply won't find anywhere else.

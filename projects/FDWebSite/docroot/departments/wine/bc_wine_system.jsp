					Best Cellars classifies its wines based on their taste and style, rather than grape type or place of origin. Our selections are presented in eight distinct style categories to help you choose the right wine for any food, mood or occasion.

					Why have we chosen to categorize wine by style, using words, icons and colors? Because we want to make shopping for wine as much fun as drinking it. Because we think that it encourages you to try wonderful wines that would otherwise be overlooked on your way to Bordeaux, Burgundy, Cabernet Sauvignon and Chardonnay. Because we believe that the challenge of finding a wine that pleases you should be a multiple-choice test where all the answers are correct, rather than a long and complicated essay question that you could easily get wrong.

					<img src="/media/images/navigation/department/wine/fiz_header.gif" width="439" height="46" alt="FIZZY"><br>
					Our FIZZY category is comprised of both limited-production Champagne and top-quality sparkling wine. While many wine drinkers use "Champagne" to describe any wine that sparkles, true Champagne comes only from a region of France located about 100 miles northeast of Paris. Sparkling wine, on the other hand, can be used to describe just about any fizz that doesn't come from Champagne. When made with the same care and high standards as Champagne, sparkling wine can taste every bit as stylish and delicious. And, because you're not paying a premium for high-priced real estate or fancy marketing, great sparkling wine is usually an amazing value.
					<br><br>
					Examples of FIZZY wines might include a Blanc de Blancs Champagne from France, a Prosecco from Italy, a Cava from Spain, or a Methode Champenoise Brut from Australia or the United States.

					<img src="/media/images/navigation/department/wine/fre_header.gif" width="439" height="46" alt="FRESH"><br>
					FRESH wines emphasize clean, crisp flavors, with nary a trace of oak&mdash;but loads of refreshing fruitiness. Thirst quenching and food friendly from start to finish, FRESH wines make mouthwatering pre-dinner sippers and, in general, pair well with a wide range of snacks and more serious light-hearted fare. They're especially good with shellfish and oily fin fish (think of 'em as stunt-doubles for a good squeeze of lemon juice).
					<br><br>
					Examples of FRESH wines might include an Orvieto from Italy, a Muscadet de Sèvre-et-Maine from France, a Sauvignon Blanc from New Zealand, or a Vinho Verde from Portugal.

					<a name="soft"></a>
					<img src="/media/images/navigation/department/wine/sof_header.gif" width="439" height="46" alt="SOFT"><br>
					Our SOFT wines seamlessly integrate ripe fruit, refreshing acidity and other flavors into a balanced whole. Wines in the SOFT category offer noticeably more concentrated fruit than FRESH wines, and some may even feature hints of barrel fermentation, oak aging and other winemaking techniques that add texture or taste complexity. 
					<br><br>
					Examples of SOFT wines might include a Mâcon-Villages from France, a Pinot Gris from Oregon, a Pinot Bianco from Italy, or a Rueda Blanco from Spain.

					<img src="/media/images/navigation/department/wine/lus_header.gif" width="439" height="46" alt="LUSCIOUS"><br>
					LUSCIOUS wines take the tastes and textures found in many SOFT wines and bump them up a couple of notches. The fruit in these wines isn't just sun-kissed, it's super ripe. If the wines see oak, their flavors will reach beyond the level of nuance and into the realm of toasty and buttery. Their aromas can often fill a room with intoxicating scents. Many LUSCIOUS offerings - particularly Chardonnays from the New World - suggest layers of tropical fruits like mango, papaya and pineapple. Others feature melon and peach flavors. LUSCIOUS wines are usually hedonistic in style, and generally pair well with foods that are less flamboyant than they are. 
					<br><br>
					Examples of LUSCIOUS wines might include a barrel-fermented California Chardonnay, an Alsatian Pinot Gris, a Spanish Sherry, or an Australian Sémillon

					Bright. Berry-stained. Gulpable. Chillable. In-Your-Face. Right Now. Knock back a jam-jar of "JUICY" juice and these free associations would flow like a bottle of Beaujolais Nouveau. Bursting with mouthwatering fruit, JUICY wines offer a guileless, guzzling, tannin-free entrée into the world of red wine. Of course, JUICY wines make great warm-weather quaffs, especially when served slightly chilled. But they are also sensational, crowd-pleasing party wines, ready to cozy up to just about anything on the buffet table.
					<br><br>
					Examples of JUICY wines might include a Beaujolais from France, or a Rosado from Spain, a Montepulciano d'Abruzzo from Italy, or a Zinfandel ros&eacute; from California.

					Supple, subtle and at times almost silken in texture, SMOOTH wines combine their fruit-forward flavors in a single, elegantly balanced package. While SMOOTH wines may offer flavors of blackberries, cherries and cassis alongside notes of smoke, oak and freshly tanned leather, no one element dominates the mix. In that sense, they are the epitome of grace in a glass.
					<br><br>
					Examples of SMOOTH wines might include a Cabernet Franc from California, a Merlot from Chile, a Shiraz from Australia, or a Chianti from Italy.

					Wines from our BIG category offer boatloads of rich flavors for fans of full-throttle reds. Whether driven by oodles of red fruit, spicy oak, dusty tannins, dizzying alcohol or just plain mouth-filling goodness, BIG wines always arrive at their destination in grand style. By way of understatement, they make perfect companions to assertively flavored meat dishes 
					<br><br>
					Examples of BIG wines might include a Zinfandel from California, a Syrah from France, a Malbec from Argentina, or a Primitivo from Italy.

					Of course, SWEET wines are sweet. But they're also so much more. They can be made from white or red grapes. They can be sparkling or still. They can be chockablock with alcohol or light as fresh grape juice. They can taste delicious along side a terrine of foie gras or a terrine of chocolate. But the one trait that all our SWEET wines share is their absolute guarantee of sheer, unadulterated pleasure. They are unique treats anyone - and everyone - can afford to indulge in. 
					<br><br>
					Examples of SWEET wines might include a Port from Australia, a Muscat, a Sp&auml;tlese Riesling from Germany, or a Monbazillac from France.

				Everything (except the stuffing) is fully cooked by our Chefs. All you need to do is re-heat it. Recommended equipment: aluminum foil, meat thermometer (included), assorted pots, and microwave.

				There's no need to baste. Remove turkey when golden brown and a meat thermometer inserted into the thigh registers 140&deg;F. (Don't worry about undercooking; it's safe and already fully cooked.)  Rest turkey on counter for 10 minutes before carving. Carve onto a warm platter and cover loosely with foil to keep warm.

				<b>Stuffing (OVEN: about 75 minutes)</b><br>
				Remove plastic lid and cover the stuffing with aluminum foil. Place covered container on baking sheet and heat in oven 30 minutes after starting the turkey. Uncover the stuffing after 30 minutes. (This should happen at about the same time the turkey is uncovered.) Continue baking stuffing until heated through and golden brown, about 45 additional minutes. Remove from oven and cover with foil until ready to serve. 
				<br><br>
				<b>Candied Yams (OVEN: about 30 minutes)</b><br>
				Remove plastic lid and cover the container with aluminum foil. When uncovering the turkey and stuffing, place covered candied yams on baking sheet and heat in oven for 15 minutes. Uncover candied yams and continue baking until hot, about 15 additional minutes. Remove from oven and cover with foil until ready to serve. 
				<br><br>
				<b>Mashed Potatoes  (STOVETOP: about 20 minutes)</b><br>
				Remove potatoes from refrigerator 30 minutes before heating. In a suitably sized pot, heat about 1 cup of milk on stovetop over low heat. Add potatoes and heat on low for about 20 minutes. Stir occasionally from the bottom of the pot, to prevent burning. When potatoes are warmed through remove from heat and cover until ready to serve. Potatoes will keep warm for up to 20 minutes. Add more seasoning or butter to taste if desired.
				<br><br>
				<b>Creamed Corn & Gravy or Au Jus (STOVETOP: about 10 minutes)</b><br>
				Transfer each package into a suitably sized pot. Heat over low heat until barely simmering, about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Remove creamed corn from heat when warmed through and cover until ready to serve. Creamed Corn will keep warm for about 20 minutes covered. Gravy or Au Jus can be kept over very low heat for up to 20 minutes. (If gravy thickens too much just add a little water.)

				<b>Dinner Rolls (OVEN: 10-12 minutes)</b><br>
				After removing the turkey and stuffing, heat dinner rolls in the 350&deg;F oven until golden brown, about 10-12 minutes. This is just enough time to start carving the turkey. 
				<br><br>
				<b>Green Beans & Glazed Carrots (MICROWAVE: less than 5 minutes)</b><br>
				Uncover container and heat on high in the microwave for 3-4 minutes, stirring midway through. Remove when warmed through and toss once or twice. (Heat the carrots first if you don't have room in your microwave for both.) This final step should be done just as your guests are ready to sit down.

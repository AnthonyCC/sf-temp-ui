Dear FreshDirect Customer,

As you know, we at FreshDirect strive to deliver each and every delivery on time every day.  However, occasionally we are subject to unforeseen circumstances causing a delay in deliveries.  This morning we encountered such a delay, which was caused by a system outage resulting in unfortunate delays in some deliveries. 

We are adding extra delivery staff to assist in minimizing delays with today's deliveries.  However, your delivery is expected to be delayed up to one hour.  We are hopeful that your delivery delay does not cause too much inconvenience for you.

If for any reason you are not able to accept your delivery today, please call us at 1-866-283-7374 (no e-mails, please) so we may arrange an alternate delivery time.

We at FreshDirect would like to apologize for the inconvenience and thank you for your cooperation and understanding.

Your FreshDirect Customer Service Team.
1-866-283-7374

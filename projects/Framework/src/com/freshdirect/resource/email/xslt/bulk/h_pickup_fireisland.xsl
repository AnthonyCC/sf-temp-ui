SUMMER DOCKSIDE DELIVERY TO FIRE ISLAND
( http://www.freshdirect.com/help/delivery_fire_island.jsp?trk=fi_email )
Our trucks are taking to the water this summer, delivering the best food in New York to Fire Island in partnership with Fire Island Ferries. Order on the Web today and let us custom-prepare everything, from the thickness of your steaks to the grind of your coffee. All summer long, we'll be making deliveries every Friday evening to Fair Harbor and Ocean Beach, direct to the dock in our refrigerated trucks.

HOW IT WORKS
Just browse our site for your favorite summertime foods, and complete Checkout to place your order. You may place your order up to one week before delivery and as late as the night before (order early because delivery slots fill up quickly). When you check out, select from one of our Fire Island locations. 

Every Friday, we'll be at: 
Fair Harbor dock from 4:00 pm to 6:00 pm
Ocean Beach dock from 6:15 pm to 9:30 pm

We'll bring your order on our hard-to-miss floating truck. Bring a wagon (or a boat) for your boxes and a cooler for frozen items if you have a long way to go. Your food will be kept cool in our refrigerated truck until you pick it up. We'll ask to see an ID but shirt and shoes are not required.

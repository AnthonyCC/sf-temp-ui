Our food-friendly facility lets us do much of our food preparation ourselves, like roasting our own green coffee beans, dry-aging our own prime beef, and baking our own breads and pastries. And because we don't have a retail location, we don't pay expensive rent for retail space. These factors help to keep our food fresh and our costs low, and we pass the savings, and the quality, on to you.</p>"

The only catch is that they are responsible for keeping your perishable items cold and your frozen items frozen until you pick them up, so choose a neighbor you know and like — and be sure to ask their permission first.</p>"

			"Customer Agreement" : {
				"name" : "Customer Agreement",
				"detail" : "Welcome to FreshDirect. PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING TERMS OF USE AND DISCLAIMER CAREFULLY BEFORE USING THIS WEB SITE (\"Site\"). This Agreement (the \"Agreement\") is an agreement between you and Fresh Direct, Inc. (\"FreshDirect\") that states the terms and conditions under which you may use the Site and receive the FreshDirect service, which includes processing and delivery of product orders (the \"FreshDirect Service\"). Note that special terms for corporate depot and for FreshDirect Corporate Services customers are contained at the end of this Agreement, and, where applicable, those terms supplement or, to the degree that they are inconsistent, supersede these terms. Your use of the FreshDirect Service and the Site constitutes your agreement to the terms and conditions set forth below. If you do not agree with all of the terms and conditions, do not use the Site or the FreshDirect Service. <br/><br/>If you have any questions about this Agreement or the Site please access our Customer Agreement Frequently Asked Questions in the \"Help\" section of the Site or call our Customer Service team at 1-212-796-8002. <br/><br/><b>FreshDirect Satisfaction Guarantee</b><br/>All of our products and services are backed by a 100% customer satisfaction guarantee. If you are dissatisfied for any reason, we want to make it right. Just call us at 1-212-796-8002, contact us via e-mail at service@freshdirect.com or log on and use our Customer Inquiry e-mail. You have up to seven days after delivery, or until the expiration date printed on the product -- whichever is earlier -- to return grocery or perishable products and 21 days for frozen products. FreshDirect may require the return of the product with which you are dissatisfied before we substitute an acceptable item or issue a credit voucher.<br/><br/><b>FreshDirect Service</b><br/><i>Ordering through the Site</i>. Orders must be received before posted cutoff times for next day/evening delivery (See Delivery of Products below for details). Available delivery windows and associated delivery charges will be shown as you proceed through the ordering process. You can place your order anytime, up to one week before your delivery date. You can modify an existing order (including the addition or deletion of items, a change in the time or delivery date, and the cancellation of your order) via the Web (in the \"Your Account\" section of the Site) up until the posted cutoff time on the day prior to the delivery date (or earlier for weekend deliveries). To view delivery and cutoff times visit the Delivery Info section of the site. You may cancel orders via the \"Your Account\" section of the Site or by contacting our Customer Service Department at 1-212-796-8002 during posted hours. Please see the Get Help section of the site for Customer Service hours. However, modified orders are subject to price changes and a change of a delivery date may not guarantee the availability of your desired items. Cancellation of orders after the required cutoff time will result in a restocking fee equal to the sum of (A) 100% of the total dollar amount of your perishable items (since our perishable items are custom-ordered and guaranteed fresh) plus (B) 25% of the total dollar amount of your nonperishable items plus (C) 50% of the total dollar amount of your beer items, excluding fees and tax. <br/><br/><i>Price and Availability</i>. At FreshDirect we believe in offering our customers the best product at the best price. We receive fresh products every day to assure you the highest quality. Although our goal is to fulfill 100% of each order, given the perishable nature of our products, from time to time products may be unavailable due to market conditions beyond our control or to quality that is below our standards. At times when we have an item that's very similar to the item you ordered, we may make a substitution. If you're not happy with the replacement, please email us at subs@freshdirect.com. We reserve the right to limit your order or the quantity of a particular product that you may order. If we are unable to fulfill your entire order we will make every reasonable effort to contact you prior to delivery. Once you complete checkout, your price, or price per pound/ounce where applicable, is guaranteed unless you placed an order for an item where we have inadvertently listed the incorrect price. In those circumstances, we reserve the right to cancel undelivered orders for such incorrectly priced products; we will contact you immediately in such circumstances, and, of course, your credit card or checking account will not be charged. <br/><br/>Because we custom-cut, -select, and -order your perishables, the per item price you see in your shopping cart for items we price by the pound/ounce is based on an estimated weight. The final price of these items will be based on the same price per pound/ounce indicated upon completion of checkout, but the actual price is determined once we have prepared and weighed your order, and will appear on the invoice you receive at the time of delivery -- you always pay the true price for the actual weight of your products. <br/><br/><i>Delivery of Products</i>. FreshDirect uses refrigerated trucks with freezer compartments to maintain the quality and integrity of your products. To maintain the integrity of products after delivery, we recommend that you immediately refrigerate or freeze perishable items. We guarantee your products (with the exception of frozen items) will remain fresh in the delivery box at room temperature (78 degrees) for two (2) hours from the time of delivery. Frozen items must immediately be placed in a freezer.<br/><br/>To receive delivery, you must live in a residential apartment or home and you or your doorman must be present to receive your order from our driver during your selected delivery window. Additionally, after your second order with FreshDirect you may elect an alternate receiver located within your building to accept your delivery. This alternate receiver can accept your goods when you are not present at the time you had selected for delivery and shall accept the goods under all of the same terms and conditions that would apply had you accepted the delivery yourself. Anyone at the delivery address who receives the delivery is conclusively presumed to be authorized to receive the delivery. If neither you, your doorman, nor your alternate receiver is present during your selected delivery window, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to contact you and reschedule delivery (a $4.99 redelivery fee applies) for that night. In such case, if we are unable to redeliver the order to you for any reason, the order will be canceled and you will be charged a fee equal to the sum of (A) 100% of the total dollar amount of your perishable items (since our perishable items are custom-ordered and guaranteed fresh) plus (B) 25% of the total dollar amount of your nonperishable items plus (C) 50% of the total dollar amount of your beer items, excluding fees and tax.<br/><br/>In an effort to meet the committed delivery time for all of our customers, our delivery personnel cannot wait for an inspection of the items delivered. Your order will arrive with an invoice that will list all of the items you have received and were billed for. If something is missing from your order, please call our Customer Service department at 1-212-796-8002 or log on and contact us via our Customer Inquiry e-mail form.<br/><br/> In the case of inclement weather, or unforeseen delivery complications, it may be necessary to make adjustments to our delivery schedule, which will cause us to suspend chosen delivery dates and times. If there will be a significant delay, a customer service representative may call or e-mail you to let you know the status of your delivery time. We will deliver your order the first possible moment the conditions permit. We will never deliver an order past 12:30 AM without a customer's consent. If your designated delivery location (i.e., street, avenue, etc.) or day is inaccessible, rendering us unable to make the delivery, we will contact you to determine the best alternate location and/or date. <br/><br/><br/>	FreshDirect Drivers are allowed to accept tips. Customers are under no obligation to tip Drivers but have the option of doing so if exceptional service is provided by the Driver. <br/><br/><br/><i>What is the \"NY State Bottle Deposit and Handling Fee\" line on my invoice?</i>. In accordance with New York State law, FreshDirect collects a NY State Bottle Deposit of 5 cents and a Handling Fee of 3.5 cents for each bottle of certain items, such as beer, soda, mineral water and still waters.<br/><br/>Your total deposit and handling fee amount is displayed as a separate line item in your shopping cart and on your invoice. <br/><br/>If you wish to recover the deposit portion of the fees, empty bottles and cans may be redeemed at any redemption center, or you may bring them to the \"Order Pickup\" window at our facility at 23-30 Borden Avenue,Long Island City, Queens. The handling fee is charged by the bottler or manufacturer and cannot be refunded upon redemption.  FreshDirect can only redeem the deposit for the bottles and cans of products that we sell. Our drivers can not accept bottles and cans for redemption. The NY State Bottle Deposit and Handling Fee will not be charged for deliveries to New Jersey.<br/><br/><i>Credit Card Payment</i>. Your credit/debit card will be charged for your order on the day your order is delivered. Since certain perishables are priced by weight and the actual price is not known until we have prepared and weighed your order, we request credit card authorization for up to 125% of the estimated cost of perishables, but only charge you the actual cost that is determined after preparing and weighing your order. In addition, we will authorize your credit card for an amount equal to 100% of the total of the non-perishable items in your order. FreshDirect will not process orders that use an incorrect, expired, or over-the-limit credit card. We will make our best efforts to contact you if this occurs. However, in the event such an order is processed, FreshDirect reserves the right to collect funds for any uncollected transactions owed to it. FreshDirect may charge a nominal fee of $2 per order should a payment made via credit card be declined resulting in the need for alternate payment or exception processing.. If you fail to pay any fees or charges when due (which would include if a check is returned or electronic payment is rejected) or if a redelivery fee or restocking fee is imposed, FreshDirect may charge such amount directly to the credit card identified in your Customer Account Information and FreshDirect may suspend or terminate your access to the FreshDirect Service. You shall be responsible and liable for any fees, including attorneys' fees and collection costs, that FreshDirect may incur in its efforts to collect any unpaid balances from you. Your right to use the FreshDirect Service is subject to limits established by FreshDirect and/or by your credit card issuer. <br/><br/><i>Checking Account Payment</i>. To be eligible to pay for your order from a checking account, the following three conditions must be met: 1) You must have received and paid for at least two prior orders. 2) There must be a valid credit card attached to your FreshDirect customer account. 3) Your FreshDirect customer account must be in good standing.<br/><br/>Your checking account payment will be processed after your food has been prepared and weighed. FreshDirect will not process orders that use an incorrect or overdrawn checking account. We will make our best efforts to contact you if this occurs. However, in the event such an order is processed, FreshDirect reserves the right to collect funds for any uncollected transactions owed to it. FreshDirect will automatically attempt to process checking account payments two times. If the first request is declined, FreshDirect may charge a nominal fee of $2 per order to cover the cost of exception processing. If the second request is declined, FreshDirect will charge a $25 bounced check fee. Additionally, in the event that sufficient funds are not available in your checking account, FreshDirect will charge the full amount of the order to your credit card. <br/><br/>If you fail to pay any fees or charges when due or if a redelivery fee or restocking fee is imposed, FreshDirect may charge such amount directly to the credit card identified in your Customer Account Information and may suspend or terminate your access to the FreshDirect Service. You shall be responsible and liable for any fees, including attorneys' fees and collection costs, that FreshDirect may incur in its efforts to collect any unpaid balances from you. Your right to use the FreshDirect Service is subject to limits established by FreshDirect and/or by your bank. FreshDirect reserves the right to withdraw the online check payment option from any account for any reason at any time.<br/><br/>FreshDirect does not accept paper checks, food stamps, or coupons at this time.<br/><br/><i>Third-Party Information Providers and Merchants</i>.

In such instances, FreshDirect acts only as the link between you and such businesses. The purchase, payment, warranty, guarantee, delivery, maintenance, and all other matters concerning the merchandise, services, or information ordered or received from such businesses are covered by their customer agreement and policies and solely between you and such businesses.

FreshDirect uses refrigerated trucks with freezer compartments to maintain the quality and integrity of your products. To maintain the integrity of products after delivery, we recommend that you immediately refrigerate or freeze perishable items. We guarantee your products (with the exception of frozen items) will remain fresh in the delivery box at room temperature (78 degrees) for two (2) hours from the time of delivery. Frozen items must immediately be placed in a freezer. <br/><br/>To receive delivery, your requested delivery destination must be in a commercial building where FreshDirect is permitted to make deliveries and you or an alternate receiver must be present to receive your order from our driver during your selected delivery window. This alternate receiver can accept your goods when you are not present at the time you had selected for delivery and shall accept the goods under all of the same terms and conditions that would apply had you accepted the delivery yourself. Anyone at the delivery address who receives the delivery is conclusively presumed to be authorized to receive the delivery. If you and your alternate receiver are not present during your selected delivery window, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to contact you and reschedule delivery for that day. In such case, if we are unable to redeliver the order to you for any reason, the order will be canceled and you will be charged a fee equal to the sum of (A) 100% of the total dollar amount of your perishable items (since our perishable items are custom-ordered and guaranteed fresh) plus (B) 25% of the total dollar amount of your nonperishable items plus (C) 50% of the total dollar amount of your beer items, excluding fees and tax. <br/><br/>Your order will arrive with an invoice that will list all of the items you have received and were billed for. If something is missing from your order, please call our Corporate Services department at 1-212-796-8002 or log on and contact us via our Customer Inquiry e-mail form. <br/><br/>In the case of inclement weather, it may be necessary to make adjustments to our delivery schedule, which will cause us to suspend chosen delivery dates and times. If there will be a significant delay, a Corporate Services representative may call or e-mail you to let you know the status of your delivery time. We will deliver your order the first possible moment the conditions permit. If your designated delivery location (i.e., street, avenue, etc.) or day is inaccessible, rendering us unable to make the delivery, we will contact you to determine the best alternate location and/or date.<br/><br/>FreshDirect delivers case sizes of a variety of different goods, including paper towel, beverages, etc. Given the heavy weight of some of these products, and our concern for the health of our drivers, we have purchase limits on a variety of these items on our web site. Also in the interest of safety, we do not deliver to walk-ups (a building without an elevator) above the 5th floor, or deliver more than 3 cases of beverages above the 4th floor. In the event of a broken elevator, we also do not ask our drivers to carry groceries more than 5 floors. Our technology cannot, and does not, enforce these limits. We ask our customers to abide by these service limitations, as we may limit deliveries when orders exceed these requirements. Again, this limitation exists only to protect the health of our delivery staff. We appreciate your understanding and cooperation.<br/><br/>FreshDirect Drivers are allowed to accept tips. Customers are under no obligation to tip Drivers but have the option of doing so if exceptional service is provided by the Driver. <br/><br/><b>Access to the FreshDirect Service </b><br/><i>ID Number and Passwords</i>. Access to the FreshDirect Service is accomplished through the use of a user name and a password that will be issued to you upon registration. If you are a Corporate Services customer, before your registration is complete, FreshDirect will need to verify your address for delivery. You are solely responsible for any authorized or unauthorized access to your account by any person. You agree to bear all responsibility for the confidentiality of your password and all use or charges incurred from use of the FreshDirect Service with your password. You agree to notify FreshDirect promptly of any unauthorized use of your password and you will remain liable for any use of the FreshDirect Service until you notify FreshDirect of the unauthorized use of your password.<br/><br/>"

We have provided you with this policy statement to inform you of the kinds of information we may gather during your visit to the FreshDirect site (the \"Site\"), why we gather customer information, what we use the information for, under what circumstances we may disclose such information, and how you can instruct us to limit the use of that information. <br/><br/><i>Note: You must be 18 years old or older to register as a customerof FreshDirect.</i><br/><br/>If you have any questions please e-mail our Customer Service Team at service@freshdirect.com or call us at 1-212-796-8002. <br/><br/><b>1. What Information We Gather</b><br/><br/>Traffic Data Collected<br/><br/> We automatically track and collect the following information when you visit our Site: (i) your IP address; (ii) the type of computer you are using; and (iii) the type of Web browser you are using (collectively \"Traffic Data\"). Traffic Data is helpful for marketing purposes and for improving your experience on the Site.<br/><br/>Personal Information<br/><br/>In order for you to access this Site, you must enter your zip code. In order for you to purchase products that we offer via the Site, we require you to provide us with information that personally identifies you. We receive and store any information you enter anywhere on the Company\'s Site. For example, we may ask you to complete a registration form that asks for contact information (such as name, address, telephone number, and e-mail address) or an order form that asks for financial information (like credit card number, expiration date, and billing address). Additionally, when you order from the Site we may collect certain consumer information (such as products ordered and relevant promotion codes) and delivery information (such as an alternate contact, address, and telephone number in the event you are not available to accept delivery). This information is collectively referred to as \"Personal Information.\" If you communicate with us by e-mail, or otherwise complete online forms, surveys, or contest entries, any information provided in such communication may be collected as Personal Information. You may choose not to provide us with certain Personal Information. In such an event, you can still access and view much of the Site; however, you may not be able to order any products. In addition, you can choose not to provide certain optional information, but then you might not be able to take full advantage of many of the features on the Company\'s Site. <br/><br/><b>2. How We Use the Information We Gather</b><br/><br/>We use your Personal Information for such purposes as responding to your requests, processing and filling customer orders, verifying your qualifications for certain products and services, billing, improving our services, providing an enhanced and more personalized shopping experience, communicating with you, and informing you of special offers and discounts. From time to time, we may also use your Personal Information to send you free samples of new products or product brands different from those you usually order. We may provide your Personal Information to third parties to the extent necessary or desirable to fill your order or complete your transaction. For example, we may use a third party supplier for certain goods, an outside shipping company to ship orders, and we do as a matter of course use a credit card processing company to bill users for goods and services. We may also share your Personal Information as described in section 5 below. Except as provided above, and in section 5 below, we will not release your Personal Information to a third party unless you have granted us permission to do so.  <br/><br/><b>3. How We Use \"Cookies\"</b><br/><br/>A \"cookie\" is a piece of data stored on your hard drive containing information about you. FreshDirect uses cookies to identify you as a previous visitor and to allow our systems to remember your shopping cart, and other shopping information, as you browse our site. By allowing our systems to set a cookie on your computer, you will not have to log in a password more than once per visit, thereby saving you time while on our Site. Cookies can also enable us to learn your interests and enhance your experience on our Site. For example, we use cookies to let us know that you are a prior customer and to allow our systems to recall information on your product selections as you shop on our Site. We do not store any Personal Information (except your e-mail address) or financial information about you using cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but allow you to instruct your browser to prevent the use of cookies. If you disable this feature, you may still use our Site, but certain aspects of the shopping experience with FreshDirect may be impacted. <br/><br/><b>4. Log Files</b><br/><br/>We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the Site, track users\' movements, and gather broad demographic information for anonymous and aggregate use.  <br/><br/><b>5. Sharing of Personal Information </b><br/><br/>In addition to Section 2 above, we share demographic information with our partners and advertisers on an anonymous and aggregate basis. This type of data is not readily linked to any personally identifiable information.<br/><br/>We work closely with third parties to bring you our services. We share information when another company is involved in the transaction so that company can perform its functions.<br/><br/><b>6. Requesting Information from Potential and Registered Customers </b><br/><br/>Our Site provides (in areas accessible to nonregistered users) an order form for potential customers to request information about our products and services. We may direct additional communications, including e-mail, to registered customers and these potential customers that we deem may be of interest to them. Additionally, at times, we may request customer feedback about our products, our services, or your past experiences, which may be displayed on our Site and in other marketing materials. Participation in these programs is optional, and by participating you grant us a nonexclusive, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, and fully sublicensable right to use, reproduce, adapt, publish, translate, distribute, and display all or parts of your feedback and you grant us permission to use your full name or your first name, last initial, and neighborhood, as determined by FreshDirect, in connection with your feedback. To be removed from future FreshDirect e-mail campaigns (\"opt out\" request) you can simply access and update your information in the <a href=\"/your_account/manage_account.jsp\">Your Account</a> area on our Site, or notify us at <a href=\"mailto:service@freshdirect.com\">service@freshdirect.com</a>.<br/><br/><b>7. Market Research</b><br/><br/>FreshDirect may secure the services of a market research firm to collect information from you to improve our service and product mix. Your feedback is optional and results will be used in aggregate reviews.   <br/><br/><b>8. Limits to Your Privacy</b><br/><br/>Our Site may contain links to other Web sites. FreshDirect wants you to be aware that when you click on links and/or ad banners that take you to third-party Web sites, you will be subject to the third parties\' privacy policies, not ours. While we support the protection of privacy on the Internet, we are not responsible for the actions and privacy policies of third parties and other Web sites. We encourage you to read the posted privacy statement and user terms and conditions whenever interacting with, and prior to providing any personal information to, any other Web site. This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by the Company on this Site.<br/><br/><b>9. Your Security</b><br/><br/>FreshDirect takes precautions to protect your Personal Information. When our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number), that information is encrypted and is protected with encryption software. Our Site encrypts your credit card number prior to transmission over the Internet using secure socket layer (SSL) encryption technology. This technology works best when the Site is viewed using Microsoft\'s Internet Explorer or Netscape Navigator. While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to unlocked, or open, when you are just \"surfing.\"  <br/><br/>While we make reasonable efforts to safeguard your Personal Information once we receive it, no transmission of data over the Internet or any other public network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or information we transmit to you from our online products or services, and you do so at your own risk.<br/><br/><b>10. Lost or Stolen Information</b><br/><br/>You must promptly notify us if your credit card, user name, or password is lost, stolen, or used without permission. In such an event, we will note that you have canceled your credit card number, user name, or password in our system and will update our records accordingly.<br/><br/><b>11. How to limit the use of your information</b><br/><br/>Our users are given the opportunity to \"opt out\" of having their information used for purposes not directly related to placement, processing, fulfillment or delivery of a product order at the point where we ask for the information. If you prefer to \"opt out\" and not have us send you material we think may be of interest to you, such as product information, product samples, and promotional mailings/e-mails from us and sites and companies we own, then you can notify us in one of the following two ways: <br/><br/><table><tbody><tr><td width=\"20\"></td><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\">1.</td><td width=\"20\"></td><td valign=\"top\">Writing us at:<br/><br/>Customer Advocacy Group<br/>FreshDirect, LLC<br/>23-30 Borden Avenue<br/>Long Island City, New York 11101<br/><br/>If you have a catalog, brochure, or other mailing label from us,please include it with your request, otherwise just include your mailing address and your e-mail address.<br/><br/>or<br/><br/></td></tr><tr><td width=\"20\"></td><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\">2.</td><td width=\"20\"></td><td valign=\"top\">E-mailing us at service@freshdirect.com (and include your mailing address).</td></tr></tbody></table><br/><br/>Your instructions to limit the use of your information will be processed as soon as reasonably practicable. In addition, you may \"opt out\" by accessing and updating your information in the <a href=\"/your_account/manage_account.jsp\">Your Account</a> area on our Site.<br/><br/><b>12. Corrections</b><br/><br/>If any of your Personal Information changes (such as your zip code), or if you no longer desire our service, we will correct, update, or remove that personal data provided to us. This can be done by sending an e-mail with your new information to <a href=\"mailto:service@freshdirect.com\">service@freshdirect.com</a>. In addition, you may access and update your information in the <a href=\"/your_account/manage_account.jsp\">Your Account</a> area on our Site.<br/><br/><b>13.

If at any time you would like notice of changes to the Privacy Policy or the Customer Agreement, e-mail us at <a href=\"mailto:service@freshdirect.com\">service@freshdirect.com</a> from the e-mail address to which you would like the notice sent. <br/><br/><b>14. Disclosure Required by Law</b><br/><br/>We may disclose Personal Information when required by law or when we believe in good faith that such action is necessary in order to conform to the edicts of the law or comply with a court order or legal process served upon FreshDirect or any of its officers or principals. We further reserve the right to disclose such information when FreshDirect reasonably believes that it is needed to identify, contact, or bring legal action against a party who may be violating FreshDirect\'s Terms of Use or may be causing injury to or interference with FreshDirect\'s rights or property, registered customers or potential customers of FreshDirect, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities.<br/><br/><b>15.

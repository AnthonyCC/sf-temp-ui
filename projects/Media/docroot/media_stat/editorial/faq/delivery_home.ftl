						When you check out, select a delivery time as soon as the next day. A FreshDirect driver will bring the order to your door (please make sure he or she can get into the building). You'll be able to recognize our drivers by their FreshDirect uniforms &#151; and by the boxes of carefully packed fresh food they'll have with them. They'll also hand you an itemized receipt.
						<br><br>
						After your second order, we recommend authorizing an alternate recipient in your building (read more below about alternate recipients).
						<br><br>
						Please note that in order to meet our delivery times for all of our customers, drivers can't wait for an inspection of the items delivered. If anything is wrong with your order, please contact FreshDirect Customer Service right away at ${customerServiceContact}.
						<br><br>
						Bad weather or other unforeseeable traffic emergencies may force us to postpone or suspend chosen delivery dates and times. If there is a significant delay, a customer service representative will call or e-mail to update you on your delivery status.

						<b>What is the Fuel Surcharge?</b><br>
						In order to help offset the impact of dramatic rises in oil and fuel prices FreshDirect has added a fuel surcharge.

						If you think that you may not be home in time to receive your scheduled delivery, or if you miss your delivery, please call FreshDirect Customer Service at ${customerServiceContact}. When you're not home during your selected timeslot, we will do our best to redeliver your order later the same day (a &#36;${baseDeliveryFee} redelivery fee applies). If your order cannot be redelivered that day there is a restocking fee of 100% of the cost of perishable items in the order plus 25% of the cost of packaged goods plus 50% of the total amount of any beer items, excluding fees and tax.
						<br><br>
						We'll always try to deliver your order directly to you. If your building has a doorman, you may authorize him to receive orders on your behalf. After your second order, we recommend selecting a neighbor in your building to receive your order in case you're not home when we arrive. The only catch is that they are responsible for keeping your perishable items cold and your frozen items frozen until you pick them up, so choose a neighbor you know and like &#151; and be sure to ask their permission first.

						<b>Why are there so many boxes in my order?</b><br>
FreshDirect was designed to be the perfect environment for food. We separate different types of food into 12 different climate zones to ensure the quality of our products. Our design for handling food has resulted in three separate assembly processes which create separate boxes for the following:
						<ul>
							<li>Meat, Seafood, and Produce items packed together</li>
							<li>Dairy, Deli, Cheese, Coffee, and Tea items packed together</li>
							<li>Grocery, Specialty, and select non-refrigerated Produce (like bananas and tomatoes) packed together</li>
						</ul>
The number of items in a box has a direct relationship to the number of items ordered from a given department. Sometimes, boxes may be packed with only a few items depending on what you have ordered. We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and encourage you to recycle your boxes. Unfortunately, FreshDirect cannot currently pick up or re-use boxes.

						If you wish to recover this deposit, empty bottles and cans may be redeemed at any redemption center or you may bring them to our facility at 23-30 Borden Avenue, Long Island City, Queens. FreshDirect can only redeem bottles and cans of products that we sell. Our drivers cannot accept bottles and cans for redemption. Bottle deposit will not be charged for deliveries to New Jersey.

"Jet-fresh" pineapples are picked ripe in the Hawaiian Islands and flown here within days. That means they're sweeter than pineapples shipped by truck or boat from Latin America, where they're picked green. Our pineapples will stay fresh for two to three weeks, unpeeled.<BR>

Environmentally aware and health-conscious consumers love the 
all-natural flavor found in organic fruits and vegetables. 
Our buyers travel the world to find peaches, apples, onions, 
tomatoes, and just about every other fruit and vegetable grown 
by dedicated organic farmers. These small family farmsteads 
require more care and labor to raise certified organic produce. 
No harmful pesticides or chemical fertilizers are ever used to 
grow fruits.<BR>

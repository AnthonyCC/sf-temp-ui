<a name="GroundMeat"></a>
<b>Ground Meat</b>
<ul>
<li>Ground meat is the most perishable meat product</li>
<li>Our ground meat is only ground when orders are placed - it is not pre-ground ahead of time</li>

</ul>

<a name="HowToCook"></a>
<b>How to Cook</b>
<ul>
<li>Poultry must be cooked to 160-165 degrees to kill salmonella</li>
<li>When meat is cooked to at least 160 degrees, any and all[harmful] bacteria will be killed Not things like BSE or rancidity</li>
<li>For rare meat, cooking temperature should be 120-130 degrees to 140</li>
<li>The internal temperature of meat will rise 5-10 degrees after it is removed from the heat</li>
<li>The thicker the meat, the higher the internal temperature will continue to rise be upon removing from heat</li>
<li>Fresh Direct Polish Kielbasa:<br>Can be pan fried or baked in the oven.<br>If baked put in a pan with a little water and bake at about 375 F until sausage is about 170 F internal.</li>
</ul>

<a name="Taste"></a>
<b>Taste</b>
<ul>
<li>Fat content assures taste, but not tenderness</li>
<li>Different cooking methods can give you tender meat</li>
<li>Using a vinegar based marinade on meat for too long a period of time (especially overnight) will ruin its taste & quality [And texture]</li>
</ul>
<%@ include file="/includes/back_to_top.jspf" %><br><br>
<a name="FreshnessFreezing"></a>
<b>Freshness/Freezing</b>
<ul>
<li>If meat is kept refrigerated (38 degrees)[34-36 is  better but 38 will not compromise] and is used/frozen by the date on the package, the product's integrity will not be compromised</li>
<li>Standard packaging is not ideal for freezing - we do not recommend freezing meat for longer than 3 weeks without Vacuum Packaging </li>
<li>Freezing meat in improper packaging will result in crystallizing [dehydration] if it frozen for more than 3 weeks</li>
<li>Even with Vacuum Packaging, we do not recommend freezing meat for longer than 6 months</li>
<li>We recommend that meat which was frozen must be used immediately once defrosted</li>
<li>Freezing meat causes ice crystals which a break down  the cells that will cause more liquid to escape - you will lose flavor & consistency if this happens </li>
<li>"Blast Freezing" avoids cell breakdown because the meat will freeze at a much faster rate - ice crystals will be smaller, if at all</li>
<li>Never defrost meat products at room temperature - this is the perfect temperature for bacteria to grow - always defrost meat in the refrigerator or Running water or microwave</li>
<li>Marinades can be frozen with the meat - they are packaged separately[Push vacuum plus which packages it separately]</li>
</ul>

<a name="USDA"></a>
<b>USDA</b>
<ul>
<li>We take raw meat from it's point of origin and keep it in the parameters of the USDA guidelines</li>
<li>We extend the shelf life of our meat products in  our facility by maintaining a constant 34- 38 degree environment - therefore bacteria is retarded</li>
<li>We have a Microbiologist on staff</li>
<li>We test for bacteria on meat product weekly- USDA standards are once every 30 days</li>
</ul>

<a name="Miscellaneous"></a>
<b>Miscellaneous Information & Helpful Tips</b>
<ul>
<li>Marinades are sold in a separate package, but that separate package is packaged with the meat</li>
<li>There is no grading in pork products</li>
<li>Using a fork when cooking meat (especially roasts) will puncture the meat allowing the natural juices to escape - meat will become dry</li>
<li>Beef is the only meat that can be aged - other meats do not have enough fat content for aging</li>
<li>We only carry domestic meat products - imported meat may not be as fresh  And we rely only on USDA</li>

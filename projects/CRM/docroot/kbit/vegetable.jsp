<b>Vegetables are stored in the bottom crisper, do they "keep" longer if they're left in, or removed from, their plastic bags?</b><br>
While not always true for everything, I think leaving vegetables in the bag would be better in order to keep the moisture in and prevent premature wilting.  
An example of when not to keep something in the bag would be mushrooms. They need to "breathe" in order to prevent early decay.  
Assuming that the temperature will not vary whether it is in the bag or not, the key is the moisture level and every vegetable has its own reaction to cool dry air or retained moisture.

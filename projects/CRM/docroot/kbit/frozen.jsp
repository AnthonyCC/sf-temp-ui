<b>Melted Items</b><br>
If a customer calls regarding item/s that are melted, ask the following questions:
<ol><li>Did your order arrive during the timeslot you choose?</li><li>Who signed for your delivery?
</li></ol>
If the customer says doorman, confirm they had the doorman option chosen.  If the option was selected, and the order was delivered in the correct timeslot then advise the customer that we are not liable for what happens to the order once the doorman has signed for the order.
<br><br>
If the customer says the order was either delivered early and left with the doorman or was left with the doorman and they had not chosen the doorman option then issue a credit for the item.

When you receive the following message while trying to add a credit card to a customers account, it means that the credit card is being used on another account.  
<ol><li>Copy the address, note the apartment number then click home. </li>
<li>While on the home page select advance under the customer search heading. </li>
<li>In the address field paste the address and put in the apartment number. </li>
<li>Click search customer</li>
<li>If more than one customer appears then check each account for the credit card in question. You will more than likely find the card on one of these accounts. If the card is not on any of the accounts, ask the customer if they have another account or if there are any other people in the house who might have created an account. If the card is not on any other accounts, please escalate the issue to account services.

Customers are often issued partial credit for their order when items are missing, damaged, spoiled, or otherwise not in satisfactory condition, or if a customer is overcharged for an item. 
The following section shows you how to issue a credit for an item in the CRM.
<ol>
<li>If you are not there already, go to the CRM Home Page by clicking on Home in the Tool Bar.
From the Home page, follow steps 1-5 from the section Create a New Case on pages 9-12. This case should be focused on the issue the customer has with the item that the credit is being issued for, so be sure to explain the situation in the Notes section.
When you are finished, go back to the Account Details page, and you should have Edit functionality in all of the available fields.<hr class="grey1px"></li>
<li>From the Account Details page, click [Order History]. Select the order from which the item being issued credit for is from, and click on it.<br>
<b>Result:</b> You will be directed to the Order Details page.<br>
Next to the order number in the top half of the screen are three new links: View Transaction, Reverse Credit, and Issue Credit. Click Issue Credit to continue.<hr class="grey1px"></li>
<li>The Issue Credit screen displays every item sent in that delivery. Select the items to be credited, and enter the reasons for the issuing of credit in the Notes field.
When you are finished issuing credits, click [Process Credit].
<b>Result:</b> A credit is issued to the customer's account, applicable to a future order, in the amount specified. Also, the "Enter credit notes here" field changes color when a credit has been successfully issued.
